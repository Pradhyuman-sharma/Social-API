# Social-API
A backend social media web-application consist of various end-points.


It uses different types of libraries and tools like: Node.js, Express.js, mongoose, MongoDB, jwt-authentication primarily and many more.

This Project is also deployed on render:

https://social-api-mpni.onrender.com


You can access endpoints from here:
GET all users: https://social-api-mpni.onrender.com/api/users

POST Authenticate: https://social-api-mpni.onrender.com/api/authenticate

takes POST request with email and password.

PS:- It's not good practice to include .env here I am adding this just for demo purpose so that anyone can access my live database ..I will remove it in future and you can only access my database through the deployed app.
For local develeopment it will gonna be localhost/database.
